[00:00:09] Interviewer: You are now in the HeritageRoots virtual lobby. What do you notice first?
[00:00:14] Participant: The lighting and spatial sound immediately make it feel immersive. I noticed the floating panels, but wasn’t sure which gesture activates them.
[00:00:39] Interviewer: Try navigating to a new scene using the teleport tool.
[00:01:08] Participant: Teleportation is smooth, but I’d like a quick preview of where I’ll land. The fade helps, but maybe a clearer arrow would help directionally.
[00:01:33] Interviewer: How do the menus and icons feel to interact with?
[00:02:08] Participant: The icons are intuitive but slightly small. I prefer when menus curve around my view instead of staying flat in front of me.
[00:02:26] Interviewer: Can you describe how object interaction feels?
[00:02:43] Participant: Picking up artifacts feels satisfying. However, I expected some haptic feedback when I grabbed something, maybe a small vibration.
[00:03:15] Interviewer: Any technical or comfort issues?
[00:03:37] Participant: No lag, though the ambient sound loop is a little short—I noticed repetition after a few minutes.
[00:03:43] Interviewer: How would you rate the overall ease of use?
[00:04:08] Participant: Pretty intuitive overall. I’d just tweak interaction cues and maybe add a tutorial overlay at first launch.
