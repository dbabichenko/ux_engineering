[00:00:05] Interviewer: You are now in the HeritageRoots virtual lobby. What do you notice first?
[00:00:10] Participant: The lighting and spatial sound immediately make it feel immersive. I noticed the floating panels, but wasn’t sure which gesture activates them.
[00:00:26] Interviewer: Try navigating to a new scene using the teleport tool.
[00:01:00] Participant: Teleportation is smooth, but I’d like a quick preview of where I’ll land. The fade helps, but maybe a clearer arrow would help directionally.
[00:01:08] Interviewer: How do the menus and icons feel to interact with?
[00:01:41] Participant: The icons are intuitive but slightly small. I prefer when menus curve around my view instead of staying flat in front of me.
[00:02:09] Interviewer: Can you describe how object interaction feels?
[00:02:43] Participant: Picking up artifacts feels satisfying. However, I expected some haptic feedback when I grabbed something, maybe a small vibration.
[00:03:05] Interviewer: Any technical or comfort issues?
[00:03:20] Participant: No lag, though the ambient sound loop is a little short—I noticed repetition after a few minutes.
[00:03:52] Interviewer: How would you rate the overall ease of use?
[00:04:02] Participant: Pretty intuitive overall. I’d just tweak interaction cues and maybe add a tutorial overlay at first launch.
